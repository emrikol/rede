Creates an endpoint to return EXIF data of remote images.

== Description ==
Some hosting providers may not have the `exif_read_data()` plugin enabled.  It may be too much work to move an entire site just for this feature, so this plugin can be set up on a secondary site to offer EXIF data.

== Installation ==
Extract the zip file and just drop the contents in the wp-content/plugins/ directory of your WordPress installation and then activate the Plugin from Plugins page.  View the Joinhook settings in the Tools administration menu to set up the plugin.
